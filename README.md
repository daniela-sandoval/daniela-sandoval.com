## Daniela's Portfolio

Welcome! 👋🏼🌱✨

Hello! This is a repository for my personal website. I decided I wanted to make something a little quirky by incorporating SVGs and animating them using Styled Components and some sweet sweet CSS. I used React in order to make it because I absolutely love components and in the future, I hope to build a small Medium API for blog section that will display any posts I make. This site was made in order to not only test my front end chops, but also cool things like design and web responsiveness. I also wanted to show off any interesting projects I make with friends, family, and fellow devs.

Thanks for stopping by! 🐈
